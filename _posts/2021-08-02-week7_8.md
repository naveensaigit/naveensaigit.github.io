I've done the following since the last update -
<ol>
    <li>
        Made a class with some of the Kamke ODEs such that ODEs can be tested individually or all at once. Various options such as finding only one solution, finding all possible solutions, verifying the solution, timeout after <code>t</code> seconds, etc were added.
    </li>
    <li>
        I am auto generating HTML reports for each ODE that is tested so that the results are readable and bugs can be found out easily by looking at failing examples' reports.
    </li>
</ol>

Next, I will add all the ODEs and try to split them chapter wise as it is given in Kamke. Then, I plan to make an automated test suite repository which would run the entire test suite on Github Actions.
