In the last 2 weeks, I worked on polishing the PR and it got merged. Most of the changes were the documentation and other small fixes. With this, half of my project is done. It was mostly done according to what I had planned and I'm grateful to my mentors as I've passed the Mid-GSoC evaluation! I have now started working on the second part of the project -
<ol>
    <li>
        I've opened a PR for a Maple parser so that the Kamke ODEs written in Maple syntax can be parsed easily. However, I realized that most of the ODEs can be parsed using <code>sympify</code>, so this PR will be on hold. I will complete it if I have extra time left in the end.
    </li>
    <li>
        I parsed the first 300 ODEs from Kamke and made a draft PR. We will decide on a specific structure to the ODEs and then add all of them.
    </li>
</ol>

I will continue working on porting all the ODEs into SymPy.
