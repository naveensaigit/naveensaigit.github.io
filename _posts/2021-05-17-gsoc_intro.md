After more than 5-6 months of regular contributions, my project has finally been selected for GSoC 2021! I would like to thank everyone at SymPy for choosing my project! My special thanks to [Oscar Benjamin](https://www.github.com/oscarbenjamin) and [Nijso](https://www.github.com/bigfooted) for their valuable time reviewing my PRs and my proposal. 

I am working on improving the `ode` module. I will be working to add a solver for the [Riccati ODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccati_equation). You can find my project proposal here - [Rational Solutions of Riccati ODEs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14GyTe_bJJQMxlOqr_3ITSspGDxZNm8ip/view)

I hope to learn much more in this summer!
