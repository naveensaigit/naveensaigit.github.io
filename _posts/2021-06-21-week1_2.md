As discussed in the last post, I tried to fix some things that were not working correctly.
<ol>
    <li>
        Most of the code now uses <code>Poly</code> objects instead of <code>Expr</code>, so the solver is much faster than it previously was.
    </li>
    <li>
        I found out about constructing general solutions for the Riccati ODEs from their particular solutions, and it is quite easy if it has 2 or 3 particular solutions. If the ODE has only one solution, then the general solution may or may not be found depending on whether an intermediary integral can be computed or not.
    </li>
</ol>

The things that I am planning to fix next are -
<ol>
    <li>
        I couldn't fix the bug where some types of ODEs were not solvable. It has something to do with poles at infinity, although I'm not sure exactly why the algorithm is failing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Try and simplify expressions inside the function, to make sure that computation doesn't become slow.
    </li>
</ol>
