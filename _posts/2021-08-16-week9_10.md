In the final 2 weeks, I worked on the following -
<ol>
    <li>
        Added all ODEs present in Kamke into the test suite in SymPy. Added some more options to customize the testing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Created a repository on Github to automate testing the ODEs. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/naveensaigit/kamke_test_suite">here</a>. It will be shifted to SymPy's Github organization once everything is final.
    </li>
</ol>

And we've come to an end! I can't believe its been 10 weeks since I started working on this project! I would like to thank SymPy, my mentors and Google for making this happen. I hope to stick around and contribute to SymPy in my free time.
