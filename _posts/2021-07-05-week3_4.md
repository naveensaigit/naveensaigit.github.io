In the last 2 weeks, I worked on the following -
<ol>
    <li>
        I finally found out why the solver was failing for certain types of ODEs. Turns out there was a typo in the paper where the algorithm was described! After using the correct equation in a particular relation, the solver now works for all types of ODEs encountered so far.
    </li>
    <li>
        I've moved the code into a different submodule. Now the solver doesn't depend on <code>dsolve</code> and the solver's true speed can be tested directly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some examples had really complex solutions that were not simplifying. Using <code>cancel(extension=True)</code> made it work and the solutions are now verified with <code>checkodesol</code> as well.
    </li>
</ol>

Most of the hard work is done with this PR, although minor changes will take some more time. The things that I am planning to work on next are -
<ol>
    <li>
        Add a function to compute the general solution of the equation from the particular solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document everything in this PR as much as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Start the work on the second part of the project, i.e. porting all Kamke ODEs into SymPy and making a test suite.
    </li>
</ol>
